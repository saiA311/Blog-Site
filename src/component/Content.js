      "Self study VS studying at a reputed institute - Which is more effective to get into the NEET?",
    date: "December 14, 2020",
    paragraph: `If you are dedicated and confident enough for self study ..then a big YES!!

    If you move forward by self-studying
    
    Biology is 80% from NCERT only…You can attempt 75–80 question just by doing NCERT properly.
    
    Physics….for physics i will suggest to to take a person tutor…because there are few things which you really can’t study without proper support of a experienced tutor. Read Pradeep thoroughly as it is the best book i ever seen for theory….NCERT theory is really very good… For question solving have DC pandey 
    
    Chemistry - For inorganic chemistry just follow NCERT only…i am 100% sure that you will not loose even a single mark. For physical again i will suggest you to take a tutor or you can purchase plancess video lectures for chemistry. For organic do NCERT and some reference book(Best is mtg)
    
    With proper study, one can score 540+ by self studying.
    
    BUT
    
    Now imagine yourself sitting in a room, studying alone. Though you are concentrating but you don’t know the amount of competition you’ll have to face in the real EXAM.During the whole year you won’t be able to FACE the competition which exists around you. Above all , home is a place of distractions. You know siblings , neighbors , noises etc. Concentration needs PEACE.
    
    You’ll have mock tests , surprise tests etc in coaching institute. Tutors will tell you a number of tips and tricks when you are a student of a coaching . The tutors have knowledge about each and every chapter. You’ll see that many students are ahead of you in scoring marks in tests. They’ll tell you what is important and what is not that important. There are score cards , rank cards , everything. Their experience will add up to your marks.

    title: "PHYSICS KE NUMERICALS NAHI HOTE KYA KARU!!! HERE'S THE SOLUTION",
    date: " December 10, 2020",
    paragraph: `The problem with subjects PCB is, if you are scared from anyone of those, that subject won't leave an inch to haunt and remind you periodically about your weakness. And for majority of the NEET aspirants, Physics is that subject.

    Running away isn't a solution. We need to tackle it.
    
    Following are key points which will help you to rectify your problems in physics and solve the numericals efficiently   
    
    Try and understand what the concept is all about. You should know HOW AND WHY that particular concept is true. 
    Whenever you read a question, write what data is given what you have to find out WITH UNITS.
    Before solving numericals of a new concept, try to look and understand at least 5-10 numericals of that concept. This will help you getting an idea to approach questions.
    Have proper concentration while solving to avoid calculation error. 
    Draw diagrams for the questions where required because for a physics student DIAGRAM IS HIS/HER LANGUAGE OF COMMUNICATION.
    Always start with the easiest questions. No need to start with hard ones. As you gain confidence by solving the easy ones, gradually increase the toughness level.
    Solve 50-100 questions of each chapter to gain confidence.
    Your no. of Qs to solve should be directly proportional to importance of that topic. 
    Don't get frustrated. Have patience and never be tired of learning.
    Believe in yourself.

    title: "10 QUALITIES AND SKILLS AN ASPIRANT SHOULD HAVE!",
    date: " December 08, 2020",
    paragraph: ` Apart from study, there are things on which proper attention will yield good marks. These small things also matter when we have to score at a bigger stage. These qualities actually are the difference between an ordinary and an extraordinary performer.  

    Following are top 10 qualities which I think NEET aspirants must entrench in their genes.
    
    
    
    Focus- Be like Arjuna, and focus only on the fish’s eye(here NEET) 
    Humbleness- Don’t blow your own trumpet. Remain down to earth. Accept challenges with a firm conviction, victory with a smile and failure with realisation.
    Smart-learner - There are a lot of books available in the market for NEET preparation. A NEET aspirant must be smart enough to choose the right books and to choose the right content from those books. Start Practicing previous year questions and you will yourself understand which topics to prepare and which to discard.
    Balanced learner- A NEET aspirant must never study a single subject too much in depth ignoring other subjects. Although biology questions are asked more in exam but this factor is balanced by the fact that they are easier than physics and chemistry questions.
