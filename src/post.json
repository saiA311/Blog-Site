Read Pradeep thoroughly as it is the best book i ever seen for theoryâ€¦.NCERT theory is really very goodâ€¦ For question solving have DC pandey\r\n\r\n**Chemistry -**Â For inorganic chemistry just follow NCERT onlyâ€¦i am 100% sure that you will not loose even a single mark.Â For physical again i will suggest you to take a tutor or you can purchase plancess video lectures for chemistry.Â For organic do NCERT and some reference book(Best is mtg)\r\n\r\nWith proper study, one can score 540+ by self studying.\r\n\r\n**BUT**\r\n\r\nNow imagine yourself sitting in a room, studying alone. Though you are concentrating but you donâ€™t know the amount of competition youâ€™ll have to face in the real EXAM.During the whole year you wonâ€™t be able to FACE the competition which exists around you.Â Above all , home is a place ofÂ distractions.Â You know siblings , neighbors , noises etc.Â **Concentration needs PEACE.**\r\n\r\nYouâ€™ll have mock tests , surprise tests etc inÂ **coaching**Â **institute**. Tutors will tell you a number of tips and tricks when you are a student of a coaching .Â **The tutors have knowledge about each and every chapter**. Youâ€™ll see that many students are ahead of you in scoring marks in tests. Theyâ€™ll tell you what is important and what is not that important.Â **There are score cards , rank cards , everything. Their experience will add up to your marks.**\r\n\r\n**WHAT TO DO!!**\r\n\r\n- **If you are too sure, confident and dedicated - only then move forward with self study.**\r\n- **If you wish to aim high, go for coaching.**\r\n- **If you live far away from aÂ coachingÂ institute, buy DLP**\r\n\r\n**For Best Possible Results !!**\r\n\r\n**Enroll with a Reputed Institute with excellent teachers, and then you have to make your best of Self Study at home coupled with lots of daily practice of homework problems.**\r\n\r\n**Students who are very highly self motivated and self disciplined, coupled with parental guidance, support and monitoring are able to clear NEET with self studies alone, but in my opinion it takes a right mix of coaching and a lot of study at home that make the path a lot easier for a lot of students**\r\n"},{"id":160753860,"title":"PHYSICS KE NUMERICALS NAHI HOTE KYA KARU!!! HERE'S THE SOLUTION\r","date":"December 10, 2020\r","Class":["\"IMPROVE MARKS\", \"NEET\", \"PHYSICS FEAR\", \"PHYSICS\"\r"],"content":"\r\nThe problem with subjects PCB is, if you are scared from anyone of those, that subject won't leave an inch to haunt and remind you periodically about your weakness. And for majority of the NEET aspirants, Physics is that subject.\r\n\r\nRunning away isn't a solution. We need to tackle it.\r\n\r\n**Following are key points which will help you to rectify your problems in physics and solve the numericals efficiently**\r\n\r\n- Try and understand what the concept is all about. You should knowÂ **HOW AND WHY**Â that particular concept is true.\r\n- Whenever you read a question, write what data is given what you have to find outÂ **WITH UNITS**.\r\n- Before solving numericals of a new concept, try to look andÂ **understand at leastÂ 5-10 numericals**Â of that concept. This will help you getting an idea to approach questions.\r\n- Have proper concentration while solving to avoid calculation error.\r\n- Draw diagrams for the questions where required because for a physics studentÂ **DIAGRAM IS HIS/HER LANGUAGE OF COMMUNICATION**.\r\n- **Always start with the easiest questions**. No need to start with hard ones. As you gain confidence by solving the easy ones,Â **gradually increase the toughness level.**\r\n- Solve 50-100 questions of each chapter to gain confidence.\r\n- **Your no. of Qs to solve should be directly proportional to importance of that topic.**\r\n- Don'tÂ get frustrated.Â **Have patience**Â and never be tired of learning.\r\n- BelieveÂ in yourself.\r\n\r\n**_Pro Tip_**Â - The more you try to solve a numerical in correct different ways or you try to solve aÂ numerical after getting stuck in it, the better you are leaning. So, don'tÂ lose hope andÂ always try. Half of the problem is solved here.\r\n\r\nAll the best Aspirants\r\n\r\nðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„\r\n"},{"id":160736580,"title":"10 QUALITIES AND SKILLS AN ASPIRANT SHOULD HAVE!\r","date":"December 08, 2020\r","Class":["\"IMPROVE MARKS\", \"NEET\"\r"],"content":"\r\nApart from study, there are things on which proper attention will yield good marks. These small things also matter when we have to score at a bigger stage. These qualities actually are the difference between an ordinary and an extraordinaryÂ performer.\r\n\r\nFollowing are top 10 qualities whichÂ I think NEET aspirants must entrench in their genes.\r\n\r\n- _Focus_- Be like Arjuna, and focus only on the fishâ€™s eye(here NEET)\r\n- _Humbleness_-Â Donâ€™tÂ blow your own trumpet.Â Remain down to earth. Accept challenges with a firm conviction, victory with a smile andÂ failure with realisation.\r\n- *Smart-learner*Â -Â There are aÂ lot of booksÂ available in theÂ marketÂ forÂ NEETÂ preparation.Â A NEET aspirantÂ mustÂ beÂ smart enoughÂ to choose theÂ right booksÂ and to choose theÂ right contentÂ from those books. StartÂ Practicing previous year questionsÂ and you willÂ yourself understandÂ whichÂ topicsÂ toÂ prepareÂ and which toÂ discard.\r\n- **_Balanced learner_-**Â A NEET aspirant mustÂ never studyÂ aÂ single subjectÂ too muchÂ inÂ depthÂ ignoring other subjects.Â Although biology questions are asked more in exam but this factor is balanced by the fact that they are easier than physics and chemistry questions.\r\n- **_One who pushes limits_-**Â Â A NEET aspirantÂ must have the potentialÂ toÂ push his/her limit gradually day by day,Â i.e. one must gradually increase the amount of studies and hard-work as the days progress.\r\n- **_Consistency_-**Â Proceed towards your goal with average speed.Â Be like the turtle and not the rabbit.\r\n- *Covertness*Â -Â Study a lot. A lot! But never show it to others.Â Itâ€™s an undercover operation of 1/2 years.\r\n- ***Management of stress*Â -**Â Â Try meditation, go for a walk, visit local attraction.\r\n- **_Have a hobby_**Â -Â you can't just study all day, your mind needs rest too. So just have a hobby it can be anything and invest your time in that too so that you can freshen up your mind.\r\n- *Ability to ignore negative and toxic people*Â -Â if you want to get successful, then first surround yourself with positive and appreciatingÂ people. It's really important and they play a great role constant support of positivityÂ .\r\n"},{"id":160727940,"title":"INTRODUCTION TO NEET\r","date":"December 07, 2020\r","Class":["\"NEET\"\r"],"content":"\r\nDoctor is considered as one of the most prestigious profession.
