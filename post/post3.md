Apart from study, there are things on which proper attention will yield good marks. These small things also matter when we have to score at a bigger stage. These qualities actually are the difference between an ordinary and an extraordinary performer.

Following are top 10 qualities which I think NEET aspirants must entrench in their genes.

- _Focus_- Be like Arjuna, and focus only on the fish’s eye(here NEET)
- _Humbleness_- Don’t blow your own trumpet. Remain down to earth. Accept challenges with a firm conviction, victory with a smile and failure with realisation.
- *Smart-learner* - There are a lot of books available in the market for NEET preparation. A NEET aspirant must be smart enough to choose the right books and to choose the right content from those books. Start Practicing previous year questions and you will yourself understand which topics to prepare and which to discard.
- **_Balanced learner_-** A NEET aspirant must never study a single subject too much in depth ignoring other subjects. Although biology questions are asked more in exam but this factor is balanced by the fact that they are easier than physics and chemistry questions.
- **_One who pushes limits_-**  A NEET aspirant must have the potential to push his/her limit gradually day by day, i.e. one must gradually increase the amount of studies and hard-work as the days progress.
- **_Consistency_-** Proceed towards your goal with average speed. Be like the turtle and not the rabbit.
- *Covertness* - Study a lot. A lot! But never show it to others. It’s an undercover operation of 1/2 years.
- ***Management of stress* -**  Try meditation, go for a walk, visit local attraction.
- **_Have a hobby_** - you can't just study all day, your mind needs rest too. So just have a hobby it can be anything and invest your time in that too so that you can freshen up your mind.
- *Ability to ignore negative and toxic people* - if you want to get successful, then first surround yourself with positive and appreciating people. It's really important and they play a great role constant support of positivity .
