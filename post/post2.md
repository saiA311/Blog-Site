The problem with subjects PCB is, if you are scared from anyone of those, that subject won't leave an inch to haunt and remind you periodically about your weakness. And for majority of the NEET aspirants, Physics is that subject.

Running away isn't a solution. We need to tackle it.

**Following are key points which will help you to rectify your problems in physics and solve the numericals efficiently**

- Try and understand what the concept is all about. You should knowÂ **HOW AND WHY**Â that particular concept is true.
- Whenever you read a question, write what data is given what you have to find outÂ **WITH UNITS**.
- Before solving numericals of a new concept, try to look andÂ **understand at leastÂ 5-10 numericals**Â of that concept. This will help you getting an idea to approach questions.
- Have proper concentration while solving to avoid calculation error.
- Draw diagrams for the questions where required because for a physics studentÂ **DIAGRAM IS HIS/HER LANGUAGE OF COMMUNICATION**.
- **Always start with the easiest questions**. No need to start with hard ones. As you gain confidence by solving the easy ones,Â **gradually increase the toughness level.**
- Solve 50-100 questions of each chapter to gain confidence.
- **Your no. of Qs to solve should be directly proportional to importance of that topic.**
- Don'tÂ get frustrated.Â **Have patience**Â and never be tired of learning.
- BelieveÂ in yourself.

**_Pro Tip_**Â - The more you try to solve a numerical in correct different ways or you try to solve aÂ numerical after getting stuck in it, the better you are leaning. So, don'tÂ lose hope andÂ always try. Half of the problem is solved here.

All the best Aspirants
